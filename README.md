# TSLint rules for Ionic

Common TypeScript lint rules/preferences for Ionic.

## Usage

```bash
npm i -D tslint-ionic-rules
```

There is a strict flavor of lint rules, which we recommend:

```json
{
  "extends": "tslint-ionic-rules/strict"
}
```

Otherwise, extend the base rules:

```json
{
  "extends": "tslint-ionic-rules"
}
```
